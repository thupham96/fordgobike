The Bay Wheels system data is made availabel to the public by Motivate and contains information of each trip such as trip duration, start time and date, etc.


## Summary of Findings

> Some of the key findings include:
- The trip duration does not seem to depend on the age of the members.
- The average trip duration of customers is higher than that of subscribers.
- The average trip duration for female and other members is higher than that of male members.
- For different gender groups, there are similar trends for age and trip durations.
- For different user-type groups, there are similar trends for age and trip durations. There is a slightly higher age trend for the subscriber group.
- For all gender groups, the customers have longer trip duration than the subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In this project, I approach the dataset using 3 different aspects: univariate, bivariate and multivariate. For univariate exploration, I investigate distributions of individual variables. For bivariate exploration, I investigate relationships between pairs of variables in my data. For multivariate exploration, I create plots of three variables to further understand the data.
